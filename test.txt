The Command/Service Module (CSM) was one of the two United States Apollo spacecraft, used for the Apollo program which landed astronauts on the Moon between 1969 and 1972. The CSM functioned as a mother ship which carried three astronauts and the second Apollo spacecraft, the Lunar Module, to lunar orbit, and brought the three astronauts back to Earth. The CSM was developed and built for NASA by North American Aviation starting in November 1961. It was launched by itself on two suborbital and two low Earth orbit test missions using the Saturn IB launch vehicle. It was also launched twelve times on the larger Saturn V rocket, designed to propel it with the Lunar Module to the Moon. The CSM made a total of nine manned flights to the Moon.

After the Apollo lunar program, the CSM saw manned service as a crew shuttle for the Skylab program, and the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP) in which an American crew rendezvoused and docked with a Soviet Soyuz spacecraft in Earth orbit. Ending with ASTP in 1975, it had flown a total of six crewed missions to low Earth orbit.

The Command/Service Module consisted of two segments: the conical Command Module, a cabin that housed a crew of three and equipment needed for re-entry and splashdown; and the cylindrical Service Module which provided propulsion, electrical power and storage for various consumables required during a mission. The Service Module was cast off and allowed to burn up in the atmosphere before the Command Module re-entered and brought the crew home.

The CSM was initially designed to return all three astronauts from the lunar surface on a direct-descent mission which would not use a separate Lunar Module, and thus had no provisions for docking with another spacecraft. This, plus other required design changes, led to the decision to design two versions of the CSM: Block I was to be used for unmanned missions and a single manned Earth orbit flight (Apollo 1), while the more advanced Block II was designed for use with the Lunar Module. The Apollo 1 flight was cancelled after a cabin fire killed the entire crew and destroyed the Command Module during a launch rehearsal test. Corrections of the problems which caused the fire were applied to the Block II spacecraft, which was used for all manned missions
